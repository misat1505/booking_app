# Hotel Booking Next.js Project

This project encapsulates a dynamic hotel booking application powered by Next.js. Within its architecture, it accommodates two distinct user personas: the Salesman, entrusted with the creation of hotels and rooms, and the Customer, empowered to reserve specific rooms for designated time frames. Seamlessly integrated with an Express server for efficient file management and static file serving, this application thrives on MongoDB for robust data storage. Tailwind CSS enriches the interface with contemporary styling, while Firebase seamlessly handles authentication. Shadcn/ui elevates the frontend with sophisticated components, ensuring an immersive user experience. With Docker Compose, initiation and operation of the project become a streamlined affair.
